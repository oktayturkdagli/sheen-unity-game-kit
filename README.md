## Overview

Sheen Unity Game Kit is a simple package to create a Hyper-casual running game in less than 5 minutes. This package, which I developed as a final project at university, consists of three parts. I didn't have time to develop it for a long enough period of time, so it remained at a basic level and I learned a lot about editor coding.

## Input Controller

Input Controller, aims to produce a less detailed input controller with a clean interface and easy to use.With this controller a simple joystick is created to control the character.

## Character Controller

Character Controller, creates a character by choosing from previously created objects with human bone structure and dressing that object. Since I couldn't find an open source character at the time, I only set it to have/not have clothes, but it supports multiple dress changes as a substructure.

## Level Controller

Level Controller is a tool that allows to create and place user-created game objects in a regular or randomized order. When creating the Level Controller I was inspired by Dreamteck's [Forever](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/forever-endless-runner-engine-140926?srsltid=AfmBOooRskdBf6IaRmkLSgoT43fcosHwl5p1WeFY2ygtgSH51iM4KP8M) asset, but unlike Forever, I tried to make it easier and more intuitive to use.

## Results

With the knowledge I learned from this package, I started working in the autonomous bus industry and developed visual tools used in the company. You can watch a small demo in the video below or check out the project on [github](https://github.com/oktayturkdagli/sheen-unity-game-kit).
